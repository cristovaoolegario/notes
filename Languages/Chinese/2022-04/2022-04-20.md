## Note about lesson - 3

Change tone of '一' (yī - first tone), when we use it with different tones it changes its tone.

1. Changing to the 4th tone when the next char has 1st, 2nd or 3th tones:  
   一些 - yì xiē  
   一条 - yì tiáo  
   一本 - yì běn

2. Changing to the 2nd tone when faces the 4th tone in the next char:  
   一个 - yí gè
